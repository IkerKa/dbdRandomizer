It has been here long before the residents began their hunt, a barely visible silhouette from the nearby village. There are signs of inhabitation, particularly in the upper states room where strange, ritualistic markings in dried blood and dirt cover the floor. From the scale of the bloodletting, something horrid has taken place here."

Once the water was drained and the area beneath the base was revealed, the true horror of the swamp's cage was discovered. It was here that the prisoners, if that's what we should call them, were brought. Held in the water, their bodies bloating horrendously, they were plucked, one by one for the family's needs. The stilts that kept the building upright acted as the only bars that awful jail needed."

Inside, I have found small areas of snow, but also traces of something dark. Beds that probably did not hold free people. Corridors that lack warmth. I feel unwelcome inside it.

            "description": "To students who were bullied by their teachers and classmates, attending Midwich Elementary School was comparable to torture. As the Order's grip on the town's supernatural energies tightened, a transformation occurred. The childhood trauma that took place in the building manifested itself into a twisted, nightmarish design.Though desks and textbooks remain, they are eerily contrasted with stained walls, rusted chains, and hanging cadavers. Any notion that this could have been a place of innocence and learning has long since faded.The Courtyard is the main landmark on the Midwich Elementary School Map.The Courtyard contains a Generator.The Courtyard potentially contains a Totem.The Courtyard potentially contains a Chest (one will always be inside the Secret Room).The Courtyard contains numerous Lockers.The Courtyard sits in the middle of the Map and can be accessed from numerous entrances.The Courtyard contains numerous Pallets.The Courtyard contains 2 Windows.The Courtyard contains several Breakable Walls.On the Map, there is a Secret Room located in the Clock Tower out in the courtyard of the school.In order to access the Secret Room, one must repair two specific Generators in a specific order and then trigger the Endgame Collapse."
